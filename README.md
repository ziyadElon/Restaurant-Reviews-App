# Restaurant Reviews Project for FEND II Nanodegree

## Important

A file called 'key.js' has not been submitted intentionally as it has my google maps API key.
It was added to .gitignore so that it isn't publicly available.
I understand it might cause issues, for the reviewer so the file will be provided, if needed.

### Running the app
1. Create a file named 'key.js' in the root directory and add the following code:
 `const API_KEY = '{replace this text including curly braces with your API key}';`
 example: const API_KEY = 'jcnskcn_jjdknjcns';
2. Once the master branch has been cloned, set up a local server (I used 'Web server for chrome') and point to the cloned directory.
3. Set the port number.
4. Start the server.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:{portNumber}` 
6. You should see the home page.
